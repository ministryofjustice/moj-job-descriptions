# The Role

We’re recruiting for Lead Technical Architects here at [Justice Digital](https://mojdigital.blog.gov.uk/working-at-moj-ds/), to be part of our warm and collaborative teams within our Strategic Hosting Teams and the [Legal Aid Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/legal-aid-agency). Our lead architects are responsible for assuring, designing, and delivering digital services that make a genuine difference to people’s lives. Together we will collaborate to develop our strategy, connect people and build trust with clear communication, and provide empathetic technical leadership across diverse teams.

This role aligns against the [Lead technical architect role](https://ddat-capability-framework.service.gov.uk/role/technical-architect) from the Government Digital and Data Framework.

Our Lead Technical Architects will work to understand our technology, our business, and our people (colleagues, stakeholders, and users of our services), and to create an ambitious and pragmatic vision for our teams, using their technical expertise to bring our challenges and opportunities into focus alongside the views of other professions in our leadership team.

  

A Lead Technical Architect can see the big picture, understanding our complex technology landscape, and can clearly and effectively communicate that big picture by building trust, developing great relationships, and empathising with others. They provide mentoring and support to other architects and engineering leadership in their service area, and they have a good understanding of a broad range of technologies, with experience in both software engineering and commercial enterprise, as well as providing effective governance, both within our organisation, and across our suppliers.

We are a flexible organisation and we understand that people can't always work 5 days a week or might have responsibilities that sometimes clash with standard office hours. We work as flexibly as we can, including offering part time hours, so if in doubt please do get in touch. If you're the right candidate we will do our best to work around you.
