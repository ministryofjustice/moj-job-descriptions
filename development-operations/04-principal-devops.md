## The Role

This role aligns with the Principal DevOps Engineer level within the Government Digital and Data (GDD) Capability Framework:  
https://ddat-capability-framework.service.gov.uk/role/development-operations-devops-engineer#principal-dev-ops-engineer

We are recruiting a Principal DevOps Engineer to join the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) and provide technical leadership and guidance across engineering teams in Justice Digital.

OCTO sets technical direction across the organisation. It defines standards, shapes platforms and ways of working, and supports teams to build and operate services that are secure, reliable and sustainable.

This role focuses on improving how engineers work by defining standards and ensuring they are implemented through shared tooling rather than guidance alone. You will lead central teams responsible for Developer Experience (DevX) and the Developer Portal, working closely with platform, security and architecture teams.

Alongside this, you will hold Head of Profession responsibility for DevOps, supporting professional practice and capability development across the organisation.
